        <h2 class="w-100">Suicide Prevention Day 2019</h2>
        <h4 class="mb-5">September 10, 2019</h4>
        <p>
          Today is suicide prevention day. In the past year, my heart has been
          broken time and time again with the rising suicide rates. In 2017, 47k
          Americans died to suicide and 14 million Americans attempted suicide.
          And these are only the numbers hospitals and surveys were able to
          capture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know suicide is a touchy subject but I am saddened about the lack of
          people talking about it. As some of you may know, I lost a friend to
          suicide. I have had to come face to face with that reality more times
          that I would like to bare. I want to be open and honest and vulnerable
          right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many times this year I have been tempted to take my own life. It
          honestly feels easier than living in this world of hurt. If it is not
          my pains it's the pains of others that bring me down. I look at a
          hurting world and it is easy to feel hopeless, it's easy to expect
          nothing else but the darkness we live in. How could we not feel
          hopeless when every month we hear of someone take their life? A
          pastor, an influencer, a friend, how am I different? What makes my
          life any different from theirs? It's so easy to lose hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hate that I am told just to have faith or to choose happiness. Don't
          get me wrong, I do wholeheartedly believe in the power that the Holy
          Spirit has to give joy but joy doesn't always come overnight. This
          thinking hurts people within and outside of the church, placing the
          blame of our hurt on our lack of faith or maybe lack of practicing
          faith. That is simply not true!
        </p>
        <p>
          To those who are suffering from depression or anxiety, please know it
          is not your fault. You do not need to deny your true feelings to heal
          from your feelings. Embrace them, do not shy away from them. Process
          them but also keep in mind that these feelings are not permanent. I
          truly encourage you to find a community, no matter how hard it is.
          Just one person that you can open up with, please. We will not suffer
          forever. We can simultaneously be honest with our feelings yet have
          faith that Jesus will come back and free us of our hurt.
        </p>

          How? I don’t have the silver bullet answer to that. I am asking myself
          the same question. But I find comfort knowing that there are other
          people like me with the same burden. I find comfort when I remind
          myself that I am not alone even when I feel like I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was debating about posting about this shirt but I feel some might
          find comfort in its message. The intention of this shirt was to raise
          awareness of suicide and mental health. I had been working on a
          campaign for Unseen Threads but I wasn’t able to complete it in time
          for this day. I’m more disappointed now with the lack of posts about
          Suicide Prevention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The message says “As You Are” in reverse. It is intended to be read by
          the wearer in the mirror where the message becomes readable. It’s
          intended to be a reminder that you don’t have to do anything to be
          loved. You don’t have to fix yourself to be welcomed. You don’t have
          to be “right” before God. This shirt was intended to simultaneously
          remind the wearer that they are worthy of love while also breaking the
          stigma of mental health for those around them. My vision is that those
          who wear this shirt are being real with their hurts and telling others
          that it's okay to hurt too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know for me, I find healing when I see others be vulnerable about
          their pains. So I want that for you too, whoever you are. I hope that
          you find comfort knowing that I too struggle with suicidal thoughts,
          anxiety, and depression. I hope that you know that you are not alone.
          And to everyone else, please check in on us.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are contemplating suicide call <strong>1-800-273-8255</strong>, there is no
          shame.
